Another thing to consider is how often you will be using your desktop and which photos or images will best represent that space. If you live in a place where there&rsquo;s always something new and exciting going on, then by all means go for an updated wallpaper every time! However, if you&rsquo;re more likely to use your desktop just once or twice a week, then sticking with a default wallpaper may be the best decision for you.</p><h2 id=kyoto-à-noël---décorations-illuminations-nocturnes-et-shopping>Kyoto à Noël - Décorations, Illuminations Nocturnes Et Shopping<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kyoto-à-noël---décorations-illuminations-nocturnes-et-shopping>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.kanpai.fr/sites/default/files/styles/og/public/uploads/2018/11/noel-kyoto-5.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.s3W4am0GyKGSdgpDR1H9tAHaEd&pid=15.1"' alt="Kyoto à Noël - Décorations, illuminations nocturnes et shopping"><p><em>Source: kanpai.fr</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>1920x1080 is a standard resolution for many modern gaming laptops.
