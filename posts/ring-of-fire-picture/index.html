Computer security is a complex and growing field, with many potential threats to users&rsquo; privacy and safety. However, many people believe that using computers is still a safe practice, especially if done responsibly. Here are four ways to ensure your computer is secure:</p><ol><li><p>Use a password manager. A password manager keeps your passwords separated from other personal information, making them difficult to guess or hack into.</p></li><li><p>Keep your computer clean. Dust, dirt, and other debris can collect on your computer screen and keyboard, which could lead to data loss or theft. Cleaning your computer once a week will help keep it running smoothly and free from potential security risks.</p></li><li><p>Use screensavers that disable user input. Screensavers are usually designed to distract users from working on their computers outside of the scope of the screensaver&rsquo;s function.</p></li></ol><h2 id=burning-ring-of-fire-by-golex-on-deviantart>Burning Ring Of Fire By Golex On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#burning-ring-of-fire-by-golex-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs10/i/2006/116/d/c/Burning_Ring_Of_Fire_by_Golex.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.sHnV_NLhsqlL_7V9C0QMFgHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Burning Ring Of Fire by Golex on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: golex.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ring fire burning deviantart.</p></blockquote><p>How to change a default Android wallpaper
