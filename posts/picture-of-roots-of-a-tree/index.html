Choosing a background for your desktop can be important. You want one that will help contrast and show off your computer&rsquo;s capabilities. There are many different backgrounds to choose from, but here are a few tips on how to choose the perfect one:</p><ol><li>Consider the size of your desktop. Make sure that the background is large enough to show off all of your hard work, but not so large that it becomes a distraction.</li><li>Consider the design of your desktop. Make sure that it is clean and modern looking, with no clutter or distracting images.</li><li>Check out online resources before making any decisions. There are many websites that offer user-generated backgrounds, and they can often be much better than anything you could find in-house.</li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://nawpic.github.io/tags/wallpaper-list/>Wallpaper List</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://nawpic.github.io/posts/rubia-mujer/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Rubia Mujer : Issei Sagawa</span></a>
