Graphics in games are refreshed automatically, but there is a process that is used to determine when the graphics should be refreshed. This process is called “redrawing.” In general, when the game needs to redraw some of its assets, it will do so using a function called “render.” There are a few factors that can affect how often this function will be run. For example, if the graphics card is underpowered or has low performance, then it may not be able to keep up with the request for resources from the game.
